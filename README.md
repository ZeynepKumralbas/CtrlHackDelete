## Game Name
CTRL HACK DELETE

## 🎮 Game Description
**CTRL HACK DELETE** is a multiplayer stealth and deduction game  for 2 to 5 players, where humans disguise themselves as robots to sneak through a machine-controlled world.

👤 **Humans**:
- Mimic robotic behaviors
- Sabotage the tasks completed by real robots
- Reach the Core without being caught

🔎 **Watcher**:
- Observe all players carefully
- Detect and expose the human impostors before they reach the Core

## 📖 Game Story
In a dark future ruled by artificial intelligence, nearly all humans are gone.  
But a small resistance remains  and their plan is simple but risky: act like a robot and sneak into the heart of the system.

Your goal is clear: reach the **Core** and issue the command that could end the machine rule:  
**CTRL. HACK. DELETE.**

But the robots are not blind. The Watcher patrols the area, analyzing every move. 
One wrong move... and your cover is blown.

Will you blend in well enough to survive? Or spot the intruders before it’s too late?

  <span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Estimated Points to Complete:</strong></span>
    38/164

  <span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Point Completion Logic:</strong></span>
  To estimate the effort required for each task, we adopted the Fibonacci-based point system (1, 2, 3, 5, 8). We chose this approach because it effectively captures the relative complexity and inherent uncertainty of tasks better than strict time-based estimates.
  As a newly formed team working with unfamiliar systems-such as multiplayer networking, NPC behaviors, and synchronized interactions-we anticipate unpredictability in assessing task difficulty. The Fibonacci sequence’s increasing gaps allow us to naturally express this uncertainty by giving larger tasks proportionally greater weight.
  This method also promotes better communication and shared understanding within the team, as it encourages discussion about task scope and complexity rather than exact time predictions, which are often unreliable in our context. By focusing on relative effort instead of absolute hours, we can plan sprints more clearly, balance workloads more effectively, and adapt quickly as our knowledge improves throughout development.
  Overall, Fibonacci estimation aligns well with our team’s experience level and project nature, making it a practical and flexible choice for managing effort estimation.

  <span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Sprint Review:</strong></span>
  During Sprint 1, the team aimed to build the foundation of the game by setting up the multiplayer infrastructure, implementing character control, NPC movement, developing the team selection menu, and designing the main menu.
  Most of the planned goals were successfully completed and integrated into a playable prototype. Minor bugs remain, which will be addressed in Sprint 2.
  Due to limited availability of some team members, caused by ongoing work or interview commitments, the team was able to complete 31 out of the estimated 38 points for this sprint, still covering nearly all core objectives.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong></span>
  During this sprint, the team collaborated effectively and successfully met most of the planned goals. However, two main challenges were identified:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>File Management:</strong> Some difficulties occurred during merge operations due to inconsistent or unclear file naming conventions. A clearer and unified naming strategy will be adopted for future work.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> Certain members had limited availability due to professional responsibilities. To address this, one team member has been assigned to support their workload-particularly focusing on UI/design tasks-in the upcoming sprint.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These insights will help guide improvements in workflow and collaboration throughout the rest of the project.</p>

  <br/>
  <span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Sprint Review:</strong></span>
    The team aimed to implement Watcher control mechanics, task-based NPCs, the sabotage system, enhancements to the main menu and designing the environment.
    Most of the planned goals were successfully completed and integrated into the game. A new playable prototype now includes NPCs with basic task-based behaviors and Watcher-player interactions.
    Minor bugs and optimization issues were noted and will be addressed during Sprint 3.
    Some tasks planned for Sprint 2 could not be completed due to the environment not being fully implemented.
    All remaining tasks from Sprint 1 have been completed. The tasks remaining from Sprint 1 are completed. 
    The team was able to complete 57 out of the estimated 78 points for this sprint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong></span>
  <ul>  
    <li>The team maintained strong collaboration and daily communication helped resolve blockers quickly.</li>
    <li>Due to the increasing progress and the need for multiple developers to now work within the same scene, potential merge conflicts became a concern.</li>
    <li>To minimize these conflicts, the team decided to work with modular prefabs inside the shared scene, allowing individual components to be edited independently.</li>
  </ul>
