## Game Name
CTRL HACK DELETE

## 🎮 Game Description
**CTRL HACK DELETE** is a multiplayer stealth and deduction game  for 2 to 5 players, where humans disguise themselves as robots to sneak through a machine-controlled world.

👤 **Humans**:
- Mimic robotic behaviors
- Sabotage the tasks completed by real robots
- Reach the Core without being caught

🔎 **Watcher**:
- Observe all players carefully
- Detect and expose the human impostors before they reach the Core

## 📖 Game Story
In a dark future ruled by artificial intelligence, nearly all humans are gone.  
But a small resistance remains  and their plan is simple but risky: act like a robot and sneak into the heart of the system.

Your goal is clear: reach the **Core** and issue the command that could end the machine rule:  
**CTRL. HACK. DELETE.**

But the robots are not blind. The Watcher patrols the area, analyzing every move. 
One wrong move... and your cover is blown.

Will you blend in well enough to survive? Or spot the intruders before it’s too late?

    <span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;">Point Completion Logic:</span>
    To estimate the effort required for each task, we adopted the Fibonacci-based point system (1, 2, 3, 5, 8). This approach was chosen because it reflects the relative complexity and uncertainty of tasks more effectively than strict time-based estimates. As a newly formed team working with unfamiliar systems-such as multiplayer networking, NPC behaviors, and synchronized interactions—there is a degree of unpredictability in task difficulty. Fibonacci estimation helps accommodate that uncertainty by assigning increasingly spaced point values. Tasks were evaluated based on their expected effort, technical difficulty, and ambiguity, rather than absolute hours. This method enables clearer sprint planning, better workload balancing, and a shared understanding of scope among team members.
